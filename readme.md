# Introduction

These exercises and problems will hopefully build on and solidify what you have
learnt so far today.

## Disclaimer

These exercises have been put together for
[ClojureBridge Melbourne](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeMelbourne/)
so this is the first time we have run them. We hope they work and are
enjoyable, but please speak to [Jen](http://github.com/jennifersmith)
or any of the coaches if you notice any problems!

Much appreciated :squirrel:


# Where to get help

* From one of your friendly coaches
* [ClojureDocs](http://clojuredocs.org/): for finding new functions
  and examples of their use

# The Exercises

* **[[Project Euler exercises]]:** a few number-based exercises taken from
the Project Euler set of problems (see links below)
* **[[Game of Life]]:** Create Conway's Game Of Life in Clojure
* **[[Write Clojure in Clojure]]:** Write your own version of some of
  the Clojure functions you have seen today (it's actually simpler
  than it sounds!)


# More more more!
